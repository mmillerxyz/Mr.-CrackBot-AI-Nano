🛤️ Development Timeline

Phase 1: Conceptualization
	•	Initial Idea: I began by creating several rough draft firmwares for an ESP32 device called the Cheap Yellow Display. The goal was running shorter wordlists in auto mode, but I pivoted to researching the smallest, most powerful SBCs capable of password cracking—and found the NVIDIA Jetson Nano!
	•	Key Focus:
	•	Leveraging the GPU for AI-driven password cracking.
	•	Using wordlists like rockyou2024.txt and SecLists for cracking WPA/WPA2 passwords.

Phase 2: Core Functionality Development
	•	AI Wordlist Generation: Integrated an AI model to generate customized password guesses based on SSID and BSSID metadata.
	•	Handshake Capture: Automated handshake capturing using tools like airodump-ng and aireplay-ng.
	•	Deauthentication Attacks: Added functionality to force client reconnections for handshake collection.

Phase 3: Hardware Integration
	•	Jetson Nano: Optimized the project for the Jetson Nano, ensuring compatibility with its hardware constraints.
	•	Wi-Fi Adapter Setup: Tested and verified monitor mode compatibility with various adapters.
	•	GPU Utilization: Integrated hashcat for GPU-accelerated cracking.

Phase 4: Interactive User Interface
	•	UI Design: Added a user-friendly interface for monitoring networks, handshake capture, and cracking progress.
	•	Real-Time Updates: Enabled live tracking of handshake capture status and cracking progress in the UI.

Phase 5: Configuration Initialization
	•	Error Handling: Ensured the project validates required tools (e.g., airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, hashcat) before starting.
	•	Directory Setup: Automated the creation of necessary directories (e.g., data/wordlists, data/captures) during initialization.

📜 Handling the rockyou2024.txt File

Given the large size of rockyou2024.txt, the setup process includes splitting the file into manageable chunks for better performance.
	1.	Automatic Splitting During Setup:
	•	The setup.py script handles splitting automatically:

import os
import subprocess

rockyou_path = "data/rockyou2024.txt"
split_output_dir = "data/split_rockyou"
os.makedirs(split_output_dir, exist_ok=True)
subprocess.run(["split", "-l", "100000", rockyou_path, f"{split_output_dir}/rockyou_part_"])


	2.	Standalone Splitting Script:
	•	You can run the split_wordlist.sh script manually:

bash split_wordlist.sh


	•	The script is included for flexibility and redundancy.

🛠️ Installation

To set up Mr. CrackBot AI:

	1.	Clone the repository:

 2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Flash the ISO to your SD card and boot your Jetson Nano.
	4.	Split the rockyou2024.txt file (if not automatically split during setup).
